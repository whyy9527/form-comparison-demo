# Form Comparison Demo

This project demonstrates the usage of two popular form management libraries in the React ecosystem: **React Hook Form** and **Formik**. It provides a side-by-side comparison to help you understand their differences in performance, rendering behavior, and overall developer experience.

## Introduction

Managing forms in React can be challenging, especially as your application grows in complexity. **React Hook Form** and **Formik** are two widely used libraries that aim to simplify form management. This demo project provides interactive examples using both libraries, allowing you to observe their behavior and performance differences firsthand.

## Features

- **React Hook Form Demo**
  - Utilizes uncontrolled components for optimal performance.
  - Tracks and displays render counts to monitor re-rendering behavior.
  - Includes basic form validation with integration support for validation libraries like Yup.

- **Formik Demo**
  - Employs controlled components for form state management.
  - Displays render counts to observe rendering patterns.
  - Features comprehensive form validation with built-in support for Yup.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

   cd form-comparison-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

- **ReactHookFormDemo.js**: Demonstrates form management using React Hook Form.
- **FormikDemo.js**: Demonstrates form management using Formik.
- **RenderCount.js**: A utility component to track and display render counts.
- **App.js**: The main application component that renders both form demos.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues related to ESLint or dependency conflicts, consider the following steps:

1. **Delete Existing Dependencies and Lock Files**

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml
   ```

2. **Reinstall Dependencies**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   Or using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Next Steps

- **Explore the Demos**: Interact with both form demos to observe their behavior.
- **Customize Forms**: Modify form fields and validation rules to suit your needs.
- **Compare Performance**: Use the render count indicators to understand how each library handles re-rendering.

Feel free to experiment with both **React Hook Form** and **Formik** to determine which library best fits your project's requirements.
